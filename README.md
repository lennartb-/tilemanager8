tilemanager8
============

Adds, removes and edits tiles on the Windows 8 Start Screen

Due to changes Microsoft introduced in Windows 8.1, it is currently incompatible with it.
Shortcuts can be still modified, but won't show up on the Start Screen.
You'd have to manually add them (Rightclick -> Pin to Start)
